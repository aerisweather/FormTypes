# FormTypes

This is a work in progress. If you'd like to give me hand,
open an issue.

## Project goals

* Be able to generate forms from a semantic configuration
* Provide robust extension points, including:
  * Ability to customize all templates
  * Ability to easily create custom form types
* Provide an interface for binding to form UI event
* Provide a mechanism to allow for data-binding, which is not bound to ay one framework.
* Allow dynamic modification of form elements and element-sets. For example, the ability to swap out one subform for another based on some user input.
